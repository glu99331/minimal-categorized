     I firmly believe that there are never any bad questions. My goal has always been to help students in the best way possible. I never want a student to leave
     recitation or office hours feeling more lost than when they came in. I always avoiding giving away answers, and rather leading and providing students with the 
     intuition and scaffolding to mold them into excellent, hard-working students. I approach teaching with a positive manner, I encourage questions at all times, 
     regardless of whether it is course-related.
